## What information do you need from me to estimate software development work?

Project requirements: In agile software development, the project requirements are typically captured in the form of user stories and acceptance criteria. These describe the desired functionality of the software from the perspective of the end user. Having a clear understanding of your user stories and acceptance criteria can help us to estimate the amount of work required to develop the software.

Project scope: It's important to have a clear understanding of the scope of the project, including the number of features or modules that need to be developed, and any dependencies or constraints that may impact development.

Prioritization: Agile software development emphasizes prioritization of user stories based on customer needs and feedback. As the client, you would play an important role in prioritizing work based on business value and urgency. This can help us to focus the development team's efforts on the most important features and ensure that we're delivering value to the customer with each iteration.

## How much will the software development process cost?

In agile software development, the cost of the development process is not typically estimated upfront as a fixed budget. Instead, agile projects are often structured around a flexible budget that can adapt to changing requirements and priorities as the project progresses. To provide a rough estimate of the cost, it's necessary to first understand the scope of the project and the requirements of the client. This can be done through discussions and collaboration with the client to establish a clear understanding of their needs, as well as to identify any potential risks and challenges that may impact the development process. Once the scope of the project has been established, the cost of the development process can be estimated based on the level of effort required to develop the software. This involves breaking down the project into smaller, more manageable tasks and estimating the amount of time and resources required to complete each task.

## How long does software development take?

Agile software development emphasizes flexibility and adaptability, which means that the project timeline can change over time as the team gains more knowledge and experience about the project requirements. This allows the team to adjust the project timeline as necessary to ensure that they are delivering software that meets the needs of the client. The software development is typically divided into short iterations or sprints, each lasting anywhere from one to four weeks. By breaking down the project into smaller, more manageable tasks and using short iterations or sprints, the team can work efficiently to deliver high-quality software within a reasonable timeframe.

## How do you guarantee software development product quality?

Ensuring product quality in agile development involves continuous testing, user feedback, automation, and team collaboration. By following these practices and techniques, agile development teams can ensure that their software meets the needs and expectations of the client while delivering a high-quality product. We integrated testing into the development process from the start. This means that the software is continuously tested throughout the development cycle, ensuring that any defects or issues are identified and addressed early on. We also use continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) tools to automate the build, test, and deployment process. This helps ensure that the software is always in a releaseable state. Our teams use code reviews to ensure that the code is well-written, maintainable, and meets established coding standards. This helps reduce the risk of defects and improve the overall quality of the software.

## Software insurance exists?

Yes.

## How about Server and website maintenance after the successful completion of a project?

After completing a project, we offer server and website maintenance services to ensure the smooth and secure operation of your web application. We can monitor, update, backup, and troubleshoot your server and website as per your needs and preferences.
